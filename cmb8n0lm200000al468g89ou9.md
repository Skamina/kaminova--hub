🚫 No Code? No Problem.

In the world of blockchain, the spotlight often shines on developers, smart contract engineers, and protocol architects. But here's a truth not enough people talk about:

\&gt; You don’t need to write code to build in Web3.

Blockchain ecosystems are networks of people, not just software. Protocols, DAOs, and crypto startups need strategists, storytellers, researchers, growth experts, legal minds, and community builders.

That's why I created this GitHub repository:

👉 Non-Dev Blockchain Careers

A resource hub, roadmap, and portfolio guide for non-developer builders in Web3.

🎯 What the Repository Covers

Growth, Partnerships, Grants

ReFi, Narratives, and more

Each role has its own markdown file with:

👩🏽‍🚀 Who Is This For?

Law student passionate about DAOs

Designer interested in dApp UX

Researcher intrigued by token economics

Writer who wants to explain complex tech…

🧠 Why This Matters

Too many brilliant minds are discouraged from entering blockchain because they’re “not technical.”

But the decentralized future needs more than developers: It needs communicators, organizers, policy shapers, creators, and visionaries.

This repo helps unlock those paths.
