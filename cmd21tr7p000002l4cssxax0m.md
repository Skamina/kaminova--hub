I was recently invited to join a decentralized science (DeSci) project focused on space exploration. At first, I was genuinely excited—space has always sparked my curiosity and interest. But as I engaged further, I realized that the project lacked any real concern for the problems humanity is facing here on Earth. They weren’t focused on solving the urgent challenges of our time—climate change, poverty, sustainability—they simply didn’t care. So I made the decision to leave.

Elon Musk’s vision of making humanity multiplanetary is bold and inspiring, no doubt. But for some, it feels like they’re rushing toward it without considering the consequences. What I mean is: this shouldn’t be our top priority right now. We need to fix Earth before we race to colonize other planets.

We’re facing countless issues that deserve our full attention:

Climate change

Biodiversity loss

Environmental degradation

Poverty and inequality

Access to education, healthcare, and basic needs

Water scarcity, food insecurity, and energy sustainability

Of course, exploring space—Mars missions, lunar landings, scientific discoveries—is exciting and important for human progress. But it shouldn't come at the cost of ignoring our responsibilities here on Earth.

Many argue, and rightly so, that the billions spent on rockets, space stations, and Mars colonization could instead be used to fight hunger, end poverty, or prevent ecological collapse. I often wonder why so many billionaires are obsessed with escaping Earth rather than fixing it.

Even the Drake Equation, which astrophysicists use to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations, suggests there's still so much we don’t understand about life beyond Earth. So, what’s the rush?

We are actively destroying our own planet. Yet, instead of leveraging technology to restore and heal it, we’re focused on inventing ways to escape. Why not use our advanced technologies to perfect Earth, to make it livable, sustainable, and equitable for all?

I know there are individuals, organizations, and researchers doing their best—fighting for the environment, innovating for sustainability—but it’s not enough. We need a global shift in mindset.

Let’s prioritize Earth. Let’s invest in restoring what we’re losing. Let’s leverage our technology to reshape and heal this planet—before we dream of another.
